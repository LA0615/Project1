Vision Board

## Description

This vision board will display a random motivational quote for the user. Then, the user will search up GIFS that they can drag and drop onto the board that represent their goal(s).  The user will create a title for the vision board as well. The user will be able to click on previous vision board ideas. 

We wanted to build this vision board to help users stay focused and motivated when creating a goal to achieve. 
We learned how to work together as a team and the importance of communication when developing programs and applications.
